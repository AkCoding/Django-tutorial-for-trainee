    "As a computer user you know that computers don't have feelings. They don't work any faster or slower depending on if we're angry at them or if we're happy. Computers can perform millions of calculations per second, but they require us to tell them exactly what to do. If they do something else than we want them to do the problem is usually that they don't understand our instructions the way we understand them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only big difference between programming and what you're familiar with already is that instead of clicking buttons to do things we write the instructions using a **programming language**. Most programming languages consist of English words, digits and some characters that have special meanings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike people often think, programming is usually not complicated. Large programs are always made of small, simple pieces, and those pieces are written one by one. Programming languages are made to be used by humans, so if there's an easy way to do something and a difficult way to do something, you should use the easier way."

    "First of all, you don't need to be good at math. Some programmers are good at math, some are not. Programming and math are two separate things and being good or bad at one doesn't mean you are automatically good or bad at the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "You also don't need a powerful computer. I could do almost all of my programming on a 12-year-old computer if I needed to. Fast computers are nice to work with, but you don't need them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming takes time like all hobbies do. Some people learn it quickly, and some people don't. I don't expect you to read this tutorial in a couple hours and then master everything it's talking about. Take your time with things, and remember that I learned to program slowly."
